Whakkee is the name I've been using for most of my online presence for years. I don't remember where it came from, but I like the sound, so I kept it.

In 1984, I started programming on a [Sinclair ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum) and after doing other stuff than programming for quite some time, I ended up in IT after all in 1996. I've been a software developer for about 25 years, and in 2021 I switched to (technical) project management. I still like to nerd out from time to time though.

Subjects that interest me are (not in any particular order, and this is not a complete list):
- localization (l18n)
- accessibility (a11y)
- automation
- process improvement
- team collaboration
- security
- data engineering / data science
- autolayout
